services:

  # The 'setup' service runs a one-off script which initializes users inside
  # Elasticsearch — such as 'logstash_internal' and 'kibana_system' — with the
  # values of the passwords defined in the '.env' file. It also creates the
  # roles required by some of these users.
  #
  # This task only needs to be performed once, during the *initial* startup of
  # the stack. Any subsequent run will reset the passwords of existing users to
  # the values defined inside the '.env' file, and the built-in roles to their
  # default permissions.
  #
  # By default, it is excluded from the services started by 'docker compose up'
  # due to the non-default profile it belongs to. To run it, either provide the
  # '--profile=setup' CLI flag to Compose commands, or "up" the service by name
  # such as 'docker compose up setup'.
